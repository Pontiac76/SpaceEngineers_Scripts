This script is for a remote mining depo.  It turns on and off drills, and makes sure that any attached refinery has "stuff" to refine.  It will also clear out the inventory of all refineries and puts them back into cargo containers.

- Place down a foundataion of some sort to place blocks on.
- Place down at least one large cargo container, at least one refinery, and work out some power
- Make sure the refineries are connected to the cargo container
