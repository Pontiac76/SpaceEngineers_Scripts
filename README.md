My general depo of scripts for SE

**Drill Platform**
> As of 1.192.104

This script is for a remote mining depo.  It turns on and off drills based on cargo space availability, and makes sure that any attached refinery has "stuff" to refine.  It will also clear out the inventory of all refineries and puts them back into cargo containers.  It does not handle rotors or piston positions.

- Place down a foundataion of some sort to place blocks on.
- Place down at least one large cargo container, at least one refinery, and work out some power
- Make sure the refineries are connected to the cargo container

**Center Screens**
> As of 1.194.208

This script resets ALL STANDARD LCDs on any connected grid to 0% padding.  It does not handle blocks with multiple LCDs (Programmable block, ironically, is one type of block that is not handled by this script)
